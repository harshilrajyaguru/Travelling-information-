    <h2><a name="a">How do I edit the destinations in my trip?</a></h2>
    <p class="ab">Click on the Route tab on the top navigation bar. Select “Edit” under the destinations, to add and delete places, as well as change their order. You can also change the start and end cities.
        <br>Click on a destination and select “Edit Dates” to change the dates and duration spent in each destination.
        <br>You can also explore recommended destinations at the bottom of the page.</p>
    <h2><a name="b">How do I match my actual intercity travel schedule with the one suggested by the site?</a></h2>
    <p class="ab">The intercity travel scheduling you see on the Route tab displays an average duration based on the available transportation options. If you expect your flight, drive, or train/bus trip to be longer or shorter than what the site suggests, you can change it.
        <br>Click on the travel option between two destinations to see other available modes of transport. Click on it again to edit the departure and arrival times, or add notes.
        <br>Your trip's intercity travel schedule will now match the bookings you've made or plan to make. You can also edit the travel blocks on the Calendar page.</p>
    <h2><a name="c">How do I change the attractions in my trip?</a></h2>
    <p class="ab">Click on the Day by Day tab on the top navigation bar and then the Calendar option to view your schedule. You can delete attraction time blocks by clicking on the “x” located in the upper right corner of each block. To add an attraction or custom activity you can either click on an empty time slot or the “+Add” button on the right.
        <br>For ideas on what else to see and do, click on the “+Add” button and select “Explore things to do”. You can either browse recommended attractions and activities in and around the destinations in your trip or look up specific ones using the search bar on the page.</p>
    <h2><a name="d">How do I build a trip using my own list of attractions?</a></h2>
    <p class="ab">You can create a trip that contains your own set of attractions via the Favorites feature. Use the search bar at the top of the home page to find your destination. You'll be able to browse the attractions within your destination and add them to your list of Favorites.
        To add an attraction to your list, click on it, hover your mouse over the heart icon on the top right of the page, and select “save”. Once you have collected all of your attractions, click on the heart icon again to view your Favorites list. On the right hand side, you'll get an option to plan a trip that contains your list of Favorites.</p>
    <h2><a name="e">I can't find an activity in the system -- how do I add it to my trip anyway?</a></h2>
    <p class="ab">Click the “Add” button on the right side of the top navigation bar, then select “Create custom event”. You'll be able to enter the name, location, and time for your custom activity. Additionally, you can add a photo, write notes, or attach documents and links to your event.</p>
    <h2><a name="f">How do I adjust the duration I spend at an attraction?</a></h2>
    <p class="ab">In the Calendar view on the Day by Day tab, hover your mouse over the bottom border of the attraction's time block and then click and drag the border up or down to adjust the duration of your visit.
        <br>Alternatively, you can click on the attraction block to set the arrival and departure time.
        <br>If you need help resolving scheduling conflicts, click on the notification icon on the top navigation bar (it turns red when a conflict arises). Then, click the prompt for help fixing the issue and select the option for the software to recalculate the trip for the destination where the conflict occurs.</p>
    <h2><a name="g">How do I change my preferences after I've created a trip?</a></h2>
    <p class="ab">You can change preferences by clicking on the Settings gear icon on the far right of the top navigation bar and then choosing ‘Plan settings’ from the dropdown menu.
        <br>Change dates, the number and types of travelers (adults/teens/kids), your preferred start/finish times for daily sightseeing, travel pace, the types of activities you prefer, and whether distances appear in miles or kilometers. If you change your start/finish times, travel pace, and activity types, Inspirock will prompt you to confirm the recalculation of your trip to match your new preferences.
        <br>You don't have to start and finish your sightseeing at the same time every day—in the Calendar view, you can change your schedule for specific days.
        <br>To change other preferences, such as your travel style, click "+" in the top right of the page and select "Create new trip" to build a new trip with your desired preferences.</p>
    <h2><a name="h">Why should I create an account?</a></h2>
    <p class="ab">If you have an account, Inspirock automatically saves any trip you create while logged in. You can then access your trips from other computers and mobile devices. When you're signed in, you can also collaborate on your trips with others.</p>
    <h2><a name="i">I'm traveling with others—can we share and edit the same trip?</a></h2>
    <p class="ab">After creating a trip, add co-travelers to it via the Settings icon on the top navigation bar. Click on “add co-traveler” and specify the email of the co-traveler. The person will receive a notification of your invitation to see and edit the trip.
        <br>Whenever a co-traveler adjusts the trip, you can see the changes by clicking on the Notifications icon on the top navigation bar.
        <br>To remove a co-traveler, click on the Share icon on the top navigation bar, select Manage Co-Travelers, and click the X button.</p>
    <h2><a name="j">Can I show my trip to friends and family?</a></h2>
    <p class="ab">You can share trips via Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest. Click the Settings icon on the right side of the navigation bar and then click on “share trip”. You'll be able to choose the social media platform that you want to share your plan on. You can also copy your plan link and paste it where you wish to share your trip.
        <br>Please note that when sharing a trip this way, others will not be able to view custom activities and notes. This is to protect any personal information you have added to your trip.
        <br>If you would like others to see custom activities and notes in your trip, add them as co-travelers.</p>
    <h2><a name="k">I want to start my sightseeing earlier/later than the default time. How do I change this?</a></h2>
    <p class="ab">Click on the Settings icon on the navigation bar, choose “plan settings” then select the time you prefer to start your day at. (Note that your sightseeing will start at least a half-hour after the time you select in order to give you time to reach the day's first activity.) Save your selection and the software will automatically update your trip.</p>
    <h2><a name="l">How do I start some days at a different time?</a></h2>
    <p class="ab">Go to the Calendar view. If your days usually start at 10 a.m. and you want to begin a day at 9:30 a.m., click on the 9-9:30 a.m. time block, choose ?“Create custom event”, and give the activity block a name. Your sightseeing for that day will now start at 9:30 a.m., immediately following the time you blocked on the calendar.
        <br>If you want to see a specific attraction earlier than your sightseeing schedule typically begins, click the time block on the calendar, select “Explore things to do”, and search for the attraction by name. Add it to the calendar and then adjust the duration of your visit if you'd like.</p>
    <h2><a name="m">What if I want to do something, such as visit an attraction or meet a friend, at a particular time?</a></h2>
    <p class="ab">Add it to your itinerary in the Calendar view. Click an empty time block on the schedule. In the window that appears, choose “Create custom event” to add a custom activity, like meeting a friend. You'll also see options to adjust the duration and location of the event.</p>
    <h2><a name="n">Can I add notes to my trip?</a></h2>
    <p class="ab">Yes, you can add notes to any activity in your trip, including custom events and reservations. You can name the restaurant you want to eat for lunch, add a link with information about the custom activity, write out an address, and much more. You'll also be able to see your custom activity notes in the Timeline view of the Day by Day tab.</p>
    <h2><a name="o">What if my flight lands in the middle of the day or I have only a partial day available for sightseeing?</a></h2>
    <p class="ab">If you cannot visit attractions during a specific time, you can block that time off on your calendar by adding a custom activity. Click on an empty time slot or the “+Add” button to add a custom activity, like a flight or meeting.</p>
    <h2><a name="p">How do I get information about public transportation?</a></h2>
    <p class="ab">We create your initial trip assuming you're using a car for sightseeing, but you can use any type of transportation. Click on the estimated driving time between two attractions to bring up Google Maps, where you can see available transportation options.
        <br>For traveling between destinations, click the Route tab and then the travel duration/transportation mode prompt between two destinations. This will show you the different modes of transportation available, including different routes and price ranges.</p>
    <h2><a name="q">How do I fill free time in my trip?</a></h2>
    <p class="ab">On your calendar, click on an empty time slot, select “Explore things to do”, and choose an activity. The software will add that activity to that slot.</p>
    <h2><a name="r">My trip has a lot of conflicts—is there an easy way to fix it?</a></h2>
    <p class="ab">There is! The notification icon on the top navigation bar turns red whenever a new conflict appears in your trip. To let the software resolve conflicts, click the notification icon and then the “Help me fix” this prompt next to a conflict. Then, choose the option to let the software recalculate the trip in that particular city.</p>
    <h2><a name="s">How do I delete a trip?</a></h2>
    <p class="ab">To delete a trip you’ve created, navigate to the My Trips button on the top right corner, and click on “See all”. Then, hover your mouse over the trip you want to delete and a trashcan icon will appear.</p>
    <h2><a name="t">How do I delete my trips data?</a></h2>
    <p class="ab">To delete your account, navigate to your account name in the top right corner, select “My Account” and click on “Delete my account”.</p>
